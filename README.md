Building a dashboard on google sheets  
I downloaded and imported Sleep efficiency data csv file and cleaned the data after removing empty cells and other formatting.
After the data has been cleaned and normalized the data looked as follow:

Charts created was to showcase the association between age and duration (bar chart) and a pie chart showcasing the proportion of yes and no answer to smoking status. These charts can be viewed below.
